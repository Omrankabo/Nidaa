# Nidaa - نداء

## Problem Addressed
Many regions in Sudan suffer from poor internet coverage, high illiteracy, and limited access to emergency health services. In critical situations such as injury, childbirth, or chronic illness attacks, people are often unable to call for help.

## How the Solution Works
Nidaa uses two types of systems to cover regions in demand. Regions with internet coverage can use the services from the website (implemented in this demo), for other regions where no internet access, only calls can get into the system using our IVR Twilio integration to call for help.

The application is as follows (for this demo): 
- Users send a request from the website form and are given a track ID.
- Admins get request messages, then auto-match or manually match volunteers, doctors, or ambulance drivers available.
- assigned volunteer confirms and tracks the status of the request, given the request info
- After resolving the request and helping a life, the volunteer uploads his report and notes about the request for later analysis

## Expected Impact
Lives saved: Faster connection to first responders in critical situations.

Scalability: Can be extended to include blood donors, ambulances, and NGOs.

Community Empowerment: Empowers local volunteers to act immediately.

## Later features
- IVR system integration for no internet access
- Heatmap, and directions for faster reach
- abuse and fraud detection and ID verification
