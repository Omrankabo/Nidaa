# Nidaa

## Problem Addressed
Many regions in Sudan suffer from poor internet coverage, high illiteracy, and limited access to emergency health services. In critical situations such as injury, childbirth, or chronic illness attacks, people are often unable to call for help. 

## How the Solution Works


## Expected Impact
Lives saved: Faster connection to first responders in critical situations.

Scalability: Can be extended to include blood donors, ambulances, and NGOs.

Community Empowerment: Empowers local volunteers to act immediately.
